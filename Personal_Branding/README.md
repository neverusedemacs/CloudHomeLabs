## Overview

This repository is about Cloud Home Labs, what does any of
this have to do with personal branding?
You can absolutely brand yourself. It starts by purchasing your domain that
will show off you. Think of it like this, there's nothing wrong with having
a gmail email address, but how would it look to have on your resume
firstname@lastname.com (or .me, .tech, .io, or anything else)

## Domain Picking

There is some cost associated with this. You can purchase most domains in
amazon. You also DON'T have to purchase it in amazon, nor transfer it to
amazon, but outside of this guide you will have to manage dns your own way.

## Create your email

Amazon has a service to create an email
([Amazon Workmail](https://aws.amazon.com/workmail/)). I like this service
for multiple reasons, you can set access rules, inbound and outbound rules
and much more. It's $4 a month with first month free. Is this the cheapest
service? Absolutely not, but I'll leave you to do the research on which
email provider you want to use

## Hosting your site, options, etc

Amazon has a plethora of ways to host a site. You have
[Amazon Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/),
[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/),
[Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/),
[Amazon Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/),
[Amazon ElasticBeanStalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/), and
much more. No way is right or wrong, but here's the cost breakdown.
